How to Work Through a User Story, the Steps

## UX/UI

### Before Starting

Familiarize yourself with the UX research (the folder containing persona data, user interview data etc. will be linked when available) 
and “Tools & Templates” folder where you will find data related to and necessary to complete the assignments below. 

Using the [User Story Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EmWknSdwgKHQ_60-pFW-6fyjhiAqM3m1-w0WqjnSlhI/edit#heading=h.ep2rboz1tlj7), 
create a text-based User Story and task flow for User Journey that you are working with. The User Story Template has information how to use it.

Create UI mockups (described below) for each Task Flow step (documented in User Story Template) of the User Journey, 
taking into account UX Research considerations and general design considerations documentation. 

### Lo-Fi wireframe (approval required before moving forward)

### Clickable Hi-Fi prototype

Using “User Flow Template/Example” in “Templates & Tools”, create a User Flow Diagram for the User Journey using Sketch or another program of your choice. 
Save it in your User Journey folder.

## Front-end

Based on individual User Journeys UI mockups, create a list of needed ReactJS components needed
Add details of these components to the list of components needed to be created (create a location for this list)
Create each individual component needed and document these components into the [Blend Component Library Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lctqh0s-J_w2uLxH6xyQnza9--PVXv35zuwcL-hkHzU/edit#gid=0)
Once created, submit the component to the [Prifina GitHub](https://github.com/prifina/blend-ui), from there it ultimately goes to [Storybook](http://alpha.app-storybook.prifina.com/?path=/story/landing--landing).

## Back-end

- Create a list of needed API/Lambda functions based on each of the user journeys steps, using the text-based specs as a guideline
- Add functions needed to be created into the User Story 
- Create each individual function based on documentation for “how to create functions” (need to be created/work in progress) and document these functions based on “API/Lambda function documentation template” (needs to be created/work in progress) and related guidelines. 
- Once created add the function into “available functions” library (need to be created)

## Release Testing

- Based on the created API/Lambda functions and React components, a real working user journey (app/feature) can be created, tested and published.
