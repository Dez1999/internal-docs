# Data Modeling 

*This section is a snippet, looking to be expanded.* 

## Core Platform Data Model

The Prifina platform has it's own data model for its own internal needs. This is a core workstream for product 
development and the product architecture overall, and is mainly exposed publicly in developer tools and documentations 
for how applications are built and ultimately connected to the Prifina platform

## Personal Cloud Data Model

The individuals personal data cloud is where the user brings their data. This data model for the data that exists in the 
users own personal data cloud, becomes the data layer that ultimately the applications that run in the Prifina environment
are built on top of.
