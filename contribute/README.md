# Improving Together

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](https://www.prifina.com/code-of-conduct.html).

## Can You Make This Internal Site Better

If you are reading this, chances are you've gone through the onboarding process yourself recently and you are uniquely qualified to know how well this site works, and more importantly, how we can improve it. We highly encourage suggestions and recommendations, which you can send to anyone on slack or to support@prifina.com. At this stage, don't sweat the small stuff, everything helps.

## Nothing is Someone Else's Responsibility at Prifina

A core part of our culture is improving what you see and never expecting someone else to do it later (imagine if everyone thought that way, nothing would ever improve!). Jot down suggestions, and shoot those to us. We guarantee it has an impact.
