## Product Development Overview

In our product development at the highest level, we separate the development workflow into four main tracks, each having their own processess where 
development work lives. These four tracks are:

## Two Product Development Tracks

### Prototyping, testing and demonstration needs. 

We are building a very new type of concept and service that includes a lot of new user experience (UX) and feature considerations, where 
we also have to be able to validate and get feedback on various levels. For this development track to be effective, we need to 
maximize speed, flexibility, and freedom. Also, in order for feedback to be meaningful and effective, we must be able to 
communicate the product user experience thoroughly. During the prototyping stage, we want the flexibility to build more independently. 
We’ll work faster by making use of copy/paste, reusing existing designs, patterns, themes, code, widgets, dummy data etc. (Trello board).

### Production version development. 

Since we are building a “high-trust, high-quality” product, while also collaborating with very high-end and technically 
advanced partner companies and investors, we need to make sure that  our production version development, we can, at any given time pass 
any high-level security or due diligence tests. As such our product version product development must have much more strict quality control, 
especially in technology documentation, practises and security matters (Trello board).

## Tracks related to product development

### “Factory” - Working on improving our documentation tools and development assets all the time, in a documentation first approach. 
We establish these assets step by step while building our product, service, and company. (trello board).

### Partner pilots. 

Where we collaborate with some selected companies to co-create a pilot project to test some use cases in practice in the context of 
their business (trello board).

## Knowing Which Is Which

It is important for all parties involved with product development to understand the separation and need for these 
different tracks and also how those are to be used to benefit each other, while not to be mixed in the wrong way (i.e., prototyping is not production level software). 

We should use  prototyping to accelerate knowledge and testing of suitable things for the actual product version development, 
where all things developed based on prototyping will be built “natively”, strictly following on the production version development principles and best practices.

## Developing our collective workflows and tools 

When it comes to building high-quality products at scale. Our first and continuing target is to be able to make sure everyone is aligned, there is no "silent knowledge", no single "go-to person" needed, but that each person can become and continue to be independently productive in their work while caring that others can be as well. And that "everything scales" easily (making it easy to join the team and when someone leaves, things are easy to pick up & continue by others or new team member). 
There will never be "some better time in the future" to fix foundational issues or catch up with Technical Debt. Especially if wanting to be and remain among the leading companies in digital business. So the best approach is to set the foundation well, and have a continuous iterative improving mindset and foundational setup for that.
